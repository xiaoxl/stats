## Marginal probability density function
Given two continous random variables $X$ and $Y$ whose joint distribution is known, then the *marginal probability density function* is the integration of the joint probability distribution over $Y$ and vice versa. That is
$$
f_X(x)=\int_c^df(x,y)\dl3y,\quad f_Y(y)=\int_a^bf(x,y)\dl3x.

## Conditional Continous Distributions
Let $X$ and $Y$ be two random variables. The conditional probability density function of $Y$ given the occurrence of the value $x$ of $X$ is written as
$$
f_{Y\mid X}(y\mid x)=\frac{f_{X,Y}(x,y)}{f_X(x)}
$$
where $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$ gives the joint density of $X$ and $Y$ while $f_X(x)$ gives the marginal density of $X$.
