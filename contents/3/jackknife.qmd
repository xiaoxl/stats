# Delete-One Jackknife variance estimator


## History

There are many variations.
###  delete-one, delete-d 

The traditional jackknife (or leave-one-out jackknife) is a resampling technique used to estimate the variance, bias, and standard error of a statistical estimator. It is one of the earliest resampling methods, originally introduced by Maurice Quenouille (1949) and later extended by John Tukey (1958) for variance estimation.



Key Developments
- Quenouille (1949, 1956): Introduced the jackknife method for reducing bias in estimators.
- Tukey (1958): Extended the jackknife to variance estimation, making it a practical tool for uncertainty quantification.
- Shao and Wu (1989): Studied the properties of the delete-d jackknife, an extension where more than one observation is removed at a time.
- Efron and Stein (1981): Discussed the relationship between the jackknife and bootstrap, showing how both methods perform in variance estimation.


Miller (1974) - "The Jackknife: A Review"
Miller’s 1974 paper, “The Jackknife: A Review”, is one of the most comprehensive early reviews of the jackknife method. It played a crucial role in consolidating knowledge about the theory, applications, and extensions of the jackknife technique.



###  delete-one, delete-d 

1. Adaptation to Survey Sampling (1970s–1980s): In survey statistics, independent observations cannot always be assumed, as responses are often collected in geographic or administrative units (e.g., cities, census tracts, schools).
    - Krewski and Rao (1981): Proposed the delete-a-group jackknife, an extension where entire groups (rather than single observations) are deleted at a time.
    - Wolter (1985, 2007): Formalized the delete-one-group jackknife, specifically tailored for survey sampling applications.
    This adaptation allowed for more accurate variance estimation in complex survey designs, where standard variance formulas fail due to intra-group correlation.
