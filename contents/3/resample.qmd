# Resample

1. Resampling: The Big Picture
Resampling refers to any technique that repeatedly draws samples from observed data to estimate statistical properties.
It includes methods like:

   - Leave-One-Out (LOO)
   - Jackknife
   - Bootstrap
   - Permutation tests

1. Leave-One-Out (LOO)
   - Basic Idea: Remove one observation at a time and compute the statistic on the remaining data.
   - Use Case: Often used in cross-validation for model evaluation.
   - Relation to Jackknife: The jackknife is a generalization of leave-one-out, but instead of using LOO just for validation, it’s used to estimate bias and variance.

   ✅ LOO vs. Jackknife:
   - LOO is typically used for model evaluation (e.g., cross-validation).
   - Jackknife is used for bias and variance estimation of an estimator.

2. Jackknife
   - Basic Idea: Systematically remove one (or more) observations at a time and recompute the statistic to estimate bias and variance.
   - Types:
       - Leave-One-Out Jackknife: Each sample is created by removing one observation.
       - Delete-d Jackknife: Removes multiple observations per resample (useful for clustered data).
       - Delete-One-Group Jackknife: Used in survey sampling by removing predefined groups instead of individual observations.

   ✅ Relation to Bootstrap:
   - The jackknife is a precursor to the bootstrap.
   - Unlike the bootstrap, which creates many samples by random resampling, the jackknife systematically leaves out observations.

4. Bootstrap
   - Basic Idea: Create many resamples (with replacement) from the original dataset and compute the statistic on each resample.
   - Stronger than Jackknife: Instead of systematically removing one observation at a time, the bootstrap randomly samples observations (allowing duplicates).
   - More Computationally Intensive: Generates a larger number of resamples than the jackknife.
   - Advantages over Jackknife:
       - Works better for small samples.
       - Provides better confidence interval estimates.

Key Takeaways:

- LOO is used in cross-validation, while jackknife estimates variance & bias.
- Jackknife is a systematic resampling method, whereas bootstrap is a random resampling method.
- Bootstrap is more powerful but computationally expensive.
